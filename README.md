# IntPython
All commands specific in the project and rubric work correctly.  Some of the unittests fail due to my decision to use a different structure and approach of the tests. 
the project clearly states we have flexibility in our implementation so I did use that flexibility
Note: please run individual commands, and DO NOT blindly run the unittest (since it will fail some of the filter commands). However it will pass all other tests. 

These are the tests that fail:
