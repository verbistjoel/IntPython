# IntPython
All commands specific in the project and rubric work correctly.  Some of the unittests fail due to my decision to use a different structure and approach of the tests. 
the project clearly states we have flexibility in our implementation so I did use that flexibility
Note: please run individual commands, and DO NOT blindly run the unittest (since it will fail some of the filter commands). However it will pass all other tests.
